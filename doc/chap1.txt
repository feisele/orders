  [33X[0;0YThe  [5Xorders[105X-package  deals  with  [22XZ_p[122X-orders [22XÎ›[122X in semisimple [22XQ_p[122X-algebras [22XA[122X,
  where  [22XZ_p[122X  denotes the [22Xp[122X-adic integers. Its original purpose was to compute
  the  projective  indecomposable  lattices  of  such orders, and from those a
  basic  algebra  of  [22XÎ›[122X. In addition, the package offers some functionality to
  deal  with  arbitrary  lattices  over  [22XÎ›[122X.  In  particular,  it  can  compute
  representatives for the isomorphism classes of all [22XÎ›[122X-lattices inside a given
  [22XA[122X-module  [22XV[122X,  compute  homomorphism spaces betwen lattices and check whether
  two [22XÎ›[122X-lattices [22XL_1[122X and [22XL_2[122X are isomorphic.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YGeneral Design & Limitations of this Package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn order [22XÎ›[122X can be created using the function [2XZpOrderByMultiMatrices[102X ([14X2.1-1[114X).
  The following data needs to be specified:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA prime [22Xp[122X[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA  list [22X[g_1,...,g_k][122X where each [22Xg_i[122X is a list of matrices over [22XZ[122X. The
        list  [22Xg_i[122X  represents a generator of the order. More precisely, [22Xg_i[l][122X
        is  supposed  to  be  the  image  of the [22Xi[122X-th generator under the [22Xl[122X-th
        irreducible [22XQ_p[122X-representation of [22XQ_p âŠ— Î›[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA few remarks are in order here:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWe  assume  that  we  know the Wedderburn decomposition of [22XQ_pâŠ—Î›[122X. When
        dealing  with  group  algebras,  this  means  that we need to know the
        irreducible  representations  of  the  group  over  [22XQ_p[122X,  which  is  a
        non-trivial  problem. For group algebras of finite groups, we might be
        able to use [10XIrreducibleRepresentations[110X, but there is no guarantee that
        these  representations end up being defined over a small enough field.
        The  condition  that  the  images  of the generators of [22XÎ›[122X are integral
        means  in  particular  that  we  single out one particular irreducible
        lattice   as   a   "standard  lattice"  in  the  corresponding  simple
        [22XQ_pâŠ—Î›[122X-module.  For  the  purposes  of  this package it does not matter
        though which lattice we choose.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWhile  we  consider [22XA[122X as a [22XQ_p[122X-algebra, we actually ask for the images
        of  the  generators of [22XA[122X under the irreducible representations of [22XA[122X to
        be matrices over [22XQ[122X. In the case of group algebras of finite groups, it
        often  happens  that  the  irreducible  representations  over  [22XQ[122X  stay
        irreducible  over  [22XQ_p[122X, in which case we get generators of the desired
        form.  Integral  spinning will the allow us to turn this collection of
        matrices over the rationals into matrices over the integers.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNone  of  the issues mentioned above arise for [22XÎ›= Z_p S_n[122X, where [22XS_n[122X denotes
  the   symmetric   group   on  [22Xn[122X  letters.  Therefore  symmetric  groups  are
  particularly  easy  amenable  to the methods in this package, and we provide
  some functionality specific to symmetric groups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOnce  we  have  defined an order in the sense of this package, we can define
  modules  over  it.  This package supports modules that are either [22XÎ›[122X-lattices
  (i.  e.  free  as [22XZ_p[122X-modules) or [22Xp[122X-torsion modules (i. e. [22XF_p[122X-vector spaces
  with  a  [22XÎ›[122X-action).  Other  torsion  types  are  not  supported. Modules are
  internally  represented  by the images of the generators [22Xg_1,...,g_k[122X of [22XÎ›[122X in
  some  matrix  ring.  For lattices we also store (if known) an embedding in a
  direct sum of irreducible lattices.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YBasic Data Structures[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  handles two types of objects: orders and modules over orders.
  Although  you  can  define  modules  "by hand", the general idea is that you
  define  an  order  (which  essentially  means  that  you  provide  a  set of
  irreducible integral representations) and use the functions provided in this
  package  to  construct  further  modules (e. g. simple modules, projectives,
  radicals of modules) and homomorphism spaces between them.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2-1 [33X[0;0YIsZpOrder[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  [22XZ_p[122X-order  in  a semisimple [22XQ_p[122X-algebra is represented by an oject in the
  category    [10XIsZpOrder[110X.    You    may    create    such   an   object   using
  [2XZpOrderByMultiMatrices[102X  ([14X2.1-1[114X). Such an object (representing an order [22XÎ›[122X) is
  used to store information about:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe irreducible representations of [22XQ_pâŠ—Î›[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  endomorphism rings of the irreducible lattices (these are crucial
        for  efficient  computation).  At  present,  we  cannot  compute these
        efficiently  in  [5XGAP[105X  itself,  unless  the  generators of [22XÎ›[122X generate a
        finite      group      (in      which      case     we     can     use
        [2XCalculateEndomorphismRingsByReynoldsNC[102X  ([14X2.2-3[114X)). If you know that [22XQ_p[122X
        is     a     splitting     field     for    [22XQ_pâŠ—Î›[122X    you    can    use
        [2XInstallTrivialEndomorphismRings[102X  ([14X2.2-1[114X). If you have a recent version
        of  [5XMagma[105X  available,  you  can  also compute these endomorphism rings
        using   [2XCalculateEndomorphismRingsWithMAGMA[102X   ([14X2.2-4[114X).   If  you  have
        calculated  these  endomorphism  rings  by  other  means,  you can use
        [2XInstallEndomorphismRingsNC[102X ([14X2.2-2[114X) to install them.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe simple modules and the decomposition matrix of [22XÎ›[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen we refer to an "order", we will always mean an object of this type.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2-2 [33X[0;0YIsRModuleOverZpOrder[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  object  on  the  category [10XIsRModuleOverZpOrder[110X represents a right module
  over  an  order.  All  modules in this package are right modules, so we will
  usually  just  call  them  modules.  Modules  are  represented  by  a linear
  representation. The only exception is the zero module. This package supports
  three types of modules:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[13XLattices[113X:  Lattices  are  represented  by a linear representation over
        [22XZ_p[122X.  For practical purposes the package does expect the images of the
        generators  of  the  order over which the lattice is defined to lie in
        [22XZ^nÃ— n[122X (this constitutes no further theoretical restriction). Lattices
        have  the property [10XIsRLatticeOverZpOrder[110X. Lattices in this package may
        also  store  an  embedding  into a direct sum of irreducible lattices,
        which   is   crucial   for  efficient  computation.  If  lattices  are
        constructed from other lattices using functions from this package, the
        functions  will  always  compute  and  store  such an embeding for all
        lattices they create.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[13X[22Xp[122X-torsion  modules[113X: These are given by the images of the generators of
        the  order  in  some  matrix ring over [22XF_p[122X. [22Xp[122X-torsion modules have the
        property [10XIsRModuleOverZpOrderModp[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[13XThe  zero  module[113X:  This  one  has the properties [10XIsZeroRModuleRep[110X and
